Flushed the old one as it broke on some Wilma update and to be honest, bash is a bit ... clumsy for this kind of things, though still love it <3

This is still very much work in progress, but some basic classes at least to get started with :)

REQUIRES: python3 and some modules you can see in the source.

Not much error checking atm. maybe I'll add some later...

I take no responsibility of anything you decide to do with this.

## Call the script with one or more of the following arguments:
## --info --> get the guardian (whoever's credentials are being used) info
## --roles --> get the roles assigned to the credentials
## --lastlogin --> get the last login timestamp for the credentials being used

All results are returned in a kind of dict form of the information.
