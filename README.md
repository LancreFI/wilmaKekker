Check for new Wilma messages and forward them to your email

Define temp file locations, logfile location, the base URL of your Wilma instance, your credentials and the email settings

Then you just start running the script every time you want to check for new messages in Wilma.

If new messages are found, the script will send them to your email.

Works for accounts with multiple children too.
